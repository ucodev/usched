1. Dependencies

 The following dependencies are automatically installed through the 'deps' script:

  - fsop Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libfsop

  - pall Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libpall

  - panet Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libpanet

  - rtsaio Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/librtsaio

  - psched Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libpsched

  - psec Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libpsec

  - fsma Library
    * https://github.com/ucodev/libfsma

 The 'deps' script depends on 'wget' or 'curl', 'tar' and 'gunzip'. Make sure they are installed on the system.



2. Installation

 The following command will fetch all the required dependencies and install the uSched services:

   # ./deploy


 Alternatively, each of the scripts invoked by 'deploy' can be executed separately:

   # ./deps
   # ./do
   # ./install
   # ./undo


 For Raspberry PI deployment, set the build target before any of the commands above:

   # ./target rpi


 The APIs for all supported languages (bindings) are not installed by default. In order to deploy the bindings use:

   # make install_bindings_<language>

 Where language may be any of the supported languages (or the keyword 'all' to install everything). The available languages keywords are: all, csharp, java, php and python.


 If there's issues regarding certificate verification for 'wget', install the corresponding certificates package on the system, or execute the following command before deployment to enable the '--no-check-certificate' flag:

   # touch .no_certs



3. Specific Add-ons

 In order to install operating system specific scripts, run:

   # make install_classic_<distro>

 Where distro is the name of the system distribution. For example, to install Debian add-ons, run:

   # make install_classic_debian

 For operating systems incorporating the systemd, run:

   # make install_systemd



4. Starting uSched Services

   # usched start

 On FreeBSD operating systems, grant that the mqueuefs kernel module is loaded before starting the uSched Services:

   # kldload mqueuefs
   # usched start


5. Stopping uSched Services

   # usched stop
